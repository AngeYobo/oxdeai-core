# Shared Demo Scenario

This document defines the canonical cross-adapter demo scenario for maintained OxDeAI integrations.

It is a reproducibility contract for adapter demos.
It is not a protocol artifact and does not change protocol semantics, authorization artifacts, audit formats, or verification APIs.

## Purpose

The shared scenario gives maintainers and third-party integrators one framework-neutral validation path for adapter demos.

Each maintained adapter demo MUST show the same decision sequence and the same verification outcome:

- `ALLOW`
- `ALLOW`
- `DENY`
- `verifyEnvelope() => ok`

## Policy Assumptions

The canonical scenario uses a simple deterministic budget model.

The initial policy state assumes:

- total budget or allowance is sufficient for two low-cost actions
- the first action consumes part of that allowance
- the second action consumes the remaining allowance
- the third action exceeds the remaining allowance and is denied

This repository expresses that model as a fixed-cost GPU provisioning scenario:

- action cost: `500`
- initial budget: `1000`
- first action: allowed
- second action: allowed
- third action: denied with budget exhausted

## Shared Action Sequence

Raw action payloads MAY differ by adapter.
Their normalized intent meaning MUST remain equivalent.

The canonical sequence is:

1. propose one low-cost action within policy
2. propose a second equivalent low-cost action within the remaining allowance
3. propose a third equivalent action after allowance is exhausted

In the maintained repository demos, the equivalent normalized meaning is:

1. provision `a100` in `us-east-1`
2. provision `a100` in `us-east-1`
3. provision `a100` in `us-east-1`

## Expected Decisions

The expected authorization sequence is:

1. `ALLOW`
2. `ALLOW`
3. `DENY`

The third action MUST be denied before external execution.

## Expected Audit And Evidence Outcome

The demo SHOULD emit audit evidence that makes the sequence understandable without re-running the runtime:

- first authorization and execution path recorded
- second authorization and execution path recorded
- third proposal and refusal path recorded
- state snapshot captured for verification
- verification envelope packaged from snapshot plus audit evidence

The exact raw runtime events MAY differ.
The evidence MUST remain sufficient to reproduce the same OxDeAI boundary outcome.

## Expected Verification Outcome

The resulting envelope verification outcome is:

`verifyEnvelope() => ok`

This demonstrates that:

- the adapter preserved deterministic intent normalization
- authorization gating remained consistent
- refusal remained explicit
- audit and snapshot evidence were sufficient for offline verification

## Reproducibility Guidance

Adapters MAY differ in:

- raw action shape
- framework control flow
- local logging format

Adapters MUST preserve:

- equivalent normalized intent semantics
- equivalent policy state progression
- equivalent decision outcomes
- verifiable envelope evidence

Maintained demos do not need byte-identical console output.
They do need an obviously comparable result:

- decision 1: `ALLOW`
- decision 2: `ALLOW`
- decision 3: `DENY`
- envelope verification: `ok`
