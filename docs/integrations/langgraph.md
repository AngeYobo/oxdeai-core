# LangGraph Integration

## Overview

This integration kit targets LangGraph-style workflow execution.
OxDeAI sits below the graph node proposal layer and above actual tool execution.

## Install

Install workspace dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Relevant packages:

- `@oxdeai/core`
- optionally `@oxdeai/sdk`
- `@langchain/langgraph`

## Minimal Quickstart

Run the LangGraph example:

```bash
pnpm -C examples/langgraph start
```

Repository example:

- [`examples/langgraph`](../../examples/langgraph)

Expected sequence:

- `ALLOW`
- `ALLOW`
- `DENY`
- `verifyEnvelope() => ok`

The workflow node proposes actions; the adapter normalizes them into intent before OxDeAI evaluation.

## Adapter Responsibilities

For this integration, the adapter:

- normalizes node-level action proposals into intent
- provides current policy state
- invokes OxDeAI evaluation
- enforces `verifyAuthorization(...)` before execution
- emits audit events for decision and execution reasoning

Adapters are integration components.
They are not part of the protocol.

## Production PEP Wiring

Production flow:

```text
workflow node proposes action
adapter normalizes action
OxDeAI PDP evaluates policy
AuthorizationV1 returned on ALLOW
PEP verifies authorization
external side effect executes
```

Production rules:

- authorization verification MUST occur before side effects
- `DENY` MUST yield an explicit refusal path
- execution outcomes SHOULD emit audit events
- authorization artifacts SHOULD remain verifiable offline

## Shared Demo Scenario

This integration implements the canonical shared scenario described in [`shared-demo-scenario.md`](./shared-demo-scenario.md).

Expected result:

- `ALLOW`
- `ALLOW`
- `DENY`
- `verifyEnvelope() => ok`

Raw action form differs by runtime.
For this adapter, the raw proposal surface is a LangGraph workflow or node dispatch.

## Validation

Local validation command:

```bash
pnpm -C examples/langgraph validate
```

Example directory:

- [`examples/langgraph`](../../examples/langgraph)

Expected result:

- `ALLOW`
- `ALLOW`
- `DENY`
- `verifyEnvelope() => ok`

Boundary expectation:
- the denied third action does not execute
- missing authorization fails closed before execution

## Integration Notes

- LangGraph normalization typically happens at the node or tool-dispatch boundary.
- Equivalent workflow proposals SHOULD map to equivalent intents.
- Graph orchestration changes adapter code, not OxDeAI protocol semantics.
